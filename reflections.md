# What is UX? 

UX stands for User Experience. The job of an UX designer is to enhance the user satisfaction by improving the users ability to use a website. 

# How do UX Designers add value to a product team / company?

I actually met some UX designers at a Halloween party. They were saying that their job was to make wireframes for developers to work on, tell the developers how they want certain things to make whoever is visiting the website easier. They make journey maps, meaning they write out the path of the website creation and also wireframes which is a blueprint of how the website is going to be laid out. UX designers are on the product team / company to make the user experience better. Better user experience, more customers, more money.

# What does the daily work of a "UX Designer" look like?

From what I am reading, there are a lot of UX Designers who work remotely. They work closely with their clients. When they are in the office, they are working. No time for playing around. They have "design sprints." 

A design sprint is a five day series of interactive exercises. They take the product from initial design idea through prototyping and user testing. It's a process that aims their efforts at hitting clearly defined goals.
